# 🚀 Spec Kit for Google Antigravity

**Build software at the speed of thought.** This kit adapts [Spec-Driven Development](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for **Google Antigravity**, leveraging the native `.agent` workflow engine.

## ⚡️ Quick Start

1. **Clone this repo** into your workspace.
2. **Antigravity** will automatically detect the `.agent/workflows` directory.
3. **Start Vibe Coding**:

| Workflow | Phase | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/define`** | **Spec** | Drag in screenshots/sketches. Gemini 3 creates a rigorous spec. |
| **`/architect`** | **Plan** | Generates technical plans & parallel task graphs for Manager View. |
| **`/execute`** | **Build** | Spins up independent agents to build Frontend & Backend in parallel. |
| **`/verify`** | **QA** | Visual regression & logic testing using the integrated Chrome browser. |

## 🧠 The Core Philosophy

* **Artifacts over Logs**: We don't read chat logs. We review generated Artifacts (Specs, Plans, Checklists).
* **Vision First**: Specs shouldn't just be text. Use Antigravity's vision to "see" the design.
* **Manager Mode**: Don't serial-code. Use `/execute` to run multiple agents at once.
